/p/project1/jf1uids/tinyfluids/scaling_jax.py:115: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))
